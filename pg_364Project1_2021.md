## Final project 1. Topic choice

<br>

in lieu (instead of) a final exam, you will be conducting a long-term project for this class, where you will independently use the skills you have learned in this class and formally write up the results in Markdown.  

There are three separate stages to this
 1. Topic choice
 2. Exploratory statistics
 3. Final analysis and write up.

The first deadline defines and explores your topic idea. Additional deadlines build on this initial submission. 

This is due by midnight the night before your next lab on Canvas. 

See [**this page**]https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2120046/assignments/13274854) on canvas for assignment guidelines.
