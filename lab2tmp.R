#### F. Adding pictures 

9. Finally, go find a favorite picture/photo/screenshot.  Save it inside your lab 1 folder. 


6. Leave another blank line and add a new heading called *"Adding Pictures"*.  Add a blank line afterwards too.


7. Make sure the screenshot is in your Lab 1 folder. Now include a code chunk that looks similar to this, but with your user name/file name (note, it might be a .jpeg not a .png). When you run it, the screenshot should appear below the code chunk.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("GEOG364_Lab1_fig01_Picture.png")
```

Make sure the screenshot is in your Lab 1 folder. Now include a code chunk that looks similar to this, but with your user filename (note, it might be a .jpeg not a .png). When you run it, the screenshot should appear below the code chunk.  If it can't find it, ARE YOU RUNNING YOUR R PROJECT? (e.g. does it say lab 1 at the top of your screen?)
