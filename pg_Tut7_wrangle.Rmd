## Tutorial 7: Table Wrangling

This tutorial is all about manipulating spreadsheets/data.frames/tables.


 - [**Tutorial 7A: Selecting a specific column**](#Tut7a_SelColumn)
 - [**Tutorial 7B: table command: counts per group**](#Tut7b_table)
 - [**Tutorial 7C: group_by command: statistics per group**](#Tut7c_groupby)

 
## Tutorial 7A: Selecting a specific column {#Tut7a_SelColumn}

Here I am using the frost data from lab 2 as an example.

Sometimes we want to deal with only one specific column in our spreadsheet/dataframe, for example applying the mean/standard deviation/inter-quartile range command to say just the distance_to_the_coast.

To do this, we use the $ symbol. For example, here I'm simply selecting the data in the elevation column only and saving it to a new variable called elevationdata.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
elevationdata <- frost$Elevation
```

Try it yourself.  You should have seen that as you typed the $, it gave you all the available column names to choose from.

<br>

This means we can now easily summarise specific columns. For example: 

 - `summary(frost)` will create a summary of the whole spreadsheet, 
 - `summary(frost$Longitude)` will only summarise the Longitude column.  
 - `mean(frost$Dist_to_Coast)` will take the mean of the Dist_to_Coast column in the frost dataframe.

## Tutorial 7B: table command: counts per group {#Tut7b_table}

Sometimes we want to count the occurrences of some category in our dataset.  For example, if you look at the frost dataset from Lab 2, it might be interesting to know how many stations were in each US State.  

To do this, we use the table command: 

```{r, Tut7Fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_Tut7_wrangle_fig1.png')
```
So for example, to find the number of stations at each elevation, I would type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
table(frost$Elevation)
```

or to see the number at each elevation in each State, I would type

```{r, eval=FALSE}
table(frost$Elevation, frost$State)
```

## Tutorial 7C: group_by command: statistics per group {#Tut7c_groupby}

What if we want to do more than just count the number of rows?  

Well, we can use the `group_by()` and `summarise()` commands and save our answers to a new variable.  

Here we are making use of the pipe symbol, %>%,  which takes the answer from group_by and sends it directly to the summarise command.


```{r}
frost.summary.type <- group_by(frost, by=Type_Fake) %>%
                          summarise(mean(Latitude),
                                    max(Latitude),
                                    min(Dist_to_Coast))
frost.summary.type
```

Here, my code is:

 - Splitting up the frost data by the Type_Fake column<br>(e.g. one group for City, one for Airport and one for Agricultural Research) 
 - For the data rows in *each group*, calculating the mean latitude, the maximum latitude and the minimum distance to the coast 
 - Saving the result to a new variable called frost.summary.type.
 - Printing the results on the screen e.g. the furthest North/maximum latitude of rows tagged Agricultural_Research_Station is 36.32 degrees.
 

## Tutorial 7D: filtering rows and columns {#Tut7Dfilter}

Sometimes, we do not want to analyse at the entire data.frame.  Instead, we would like to only look at one (or more) columns or rows. 

There are several ways we can select data. 

 - To choose a specific column, we can use the `$` symbol to select its name (as described in Tutorial 7A)

 - If you know which number rows or columns you want, you can use **square brackets** to numerically select data.
 
Essentially our data follows the format: TABLENAME[ROWS,COLUMNS]


```{r}
# This will select the 5th row and 7th column
frost[5,7]

# This will select the 2nd row and ALL the columns 
frost[2,]

# This will select the 3rd column and ALL the rows
frost[,3]
# similar to using its name
frost$Type_Fake

# We can combine our commands, this will print the 13th row of the Longitude column 
# (no comma as we're only looking at one column)
frost$Longitude[13]

# The : symbol lets you choose a sequence of numbers e.g. 1:5 is 1 2 3 4 5
# So this prints out rows 11 to 15 and all the columns
frost[11:15,]

# The "c" command allows you to enter whatever numbers you like.  
# So this will print out rows 4,3,7 and the "Elevation" and "Dist_to_Coast" columns
frost[c(4,3,7), c("Elevation","Dist_to_Coast")]
```

### The dplyr filter command (tidyverse)

Filtering means selecting rows/observations based on their values.  To filter in R, use the command `filter()` from the dplyr package. I tend to write it as `dplyr:filter()` to force it to be correct.

Visually, filtering rows looks like this.

```{r, Tut7Fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_Tut7_wrangle_fig2.png')
```

Here we can apply the filter command to choose specific rows that meet certain criteria

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, State == "FL")
```

The double equal operator `==` means equal to.  The command is telling R to keep the rows in *frost* where the *State* column equals "FL". 

If you want a few categories, choose the %in% operator, using the `c()` command to stick together the categories you want.  For example, here are states in Florida and Virginia.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, State %in% c("FL","VA"))
```

We can also explicitly exclude cases and keep everything else by using the not equal operator `!=`.  The following code *excludes* airport stations.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, Type_Fake != "Airport")
```

What about filtering if a row has a value greater than a specified value?  For example, Stations with an elevation greater than 500 feet?

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, Elevation > 500)
```

Or less-than-or-equal-to 200 feet.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, Elevation < 200)

# or save the result to a new variable
lowland_stations <- filter(frost, Elevation < 200)

```

In addition to comparison operators, filtering may also utilize logical operators that make multiple selections.  There are three basic logical operators: `&` (and), `|` (or), and `!` (not).  We can keep Stations with an *Elevation* greater than 300 **and** *State* in Alabama `&`.

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, Elevation > 300 & State == "AL")
```

Use `|` to keep Stations with a *Type_Fake* of "Airport" **or** a last spring frost date after april (~ day 90 of the year).

```{r, results="hide"}
filter(frost, Type_Fake == "Airport" | Avg_DOY_SpringFrost > 90 )

```

### The dplyr arrange command (tidyverse)
\

We use the `arrange()` function to sort a data frame by one or more variables. You might want to do this to get a sense of which cases have the highest or lowest values in your data set or sort counties by their name. For example, let's sort in ascending order by elevation.

```{r}
arrange(frost, Latitude)
```

By default, `arrange()` sorts in ascending order. We can sort by a variable in descending order by using the `desc()` function on the variable we want to sort by. For example, to sort the dataframe by *Avg_DOY_SpringFrost* in descending order we use

```{r}
arrange(frost, desc(Avg_DOY_SpringFrost))
```
