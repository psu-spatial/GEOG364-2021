You will need to follow this process for EVERY lab

### Starting each lab check-list

We go through each of these in more detail below

**Create your project (a special folder containing the lab)**

1. Open **R-Studio**
2. Click `New Project` in the File Menu
3. Select `new directory`, then `new project`. 
4. Name your project Project_GEOG364_Lab1 (or whatever the lab number is) and create the project

**Create the file we are going to edit project (a special folder containing the lab)**

5. 

### What are projects?

[![Rproject](images/Fig_01_03VIDEO_Projects.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-r-tidyverse/why-should-you-use-projects-in-rstudio?u=76811570 "Why use R Projects")

One of the most useful new features in RStudio are R-Projects.  We are going to use R-projects to store our lab data in.  An R project is a place to store all your commands, data and output in the same place.  

Before R projects, we had to worry about where on your computer your data was saved in.  Now, we can force R-Studio to immediately look inside your lab folder - making life much easier. 

Equally, projects allow you to have multiple versions of R-studio open.  This is  useful because say you have Lab-2 open, but want to re-open Lab-1 to check some code, clicking the "Lab 1 project file" will load a whole new version of R with Lab 1 ready to edit.  

It is ***really*** important that you stay organized in this course, for example making sure you know where you put your data and your labs.
