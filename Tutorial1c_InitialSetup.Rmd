Everything in this tutorial is a one-off to get R and R-studio set up.

### Getting started

First, in an easy to access place on your computer, make a folder called GEOG-364.  This is where all your labs and projects are going to live.

**Now everything is installed, open R-studio** (NOT R!).  

```{r, tut1cfig1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Tutorial1c_fig1_RRstudiologos.png')
```

<br>

You will be greeted by three panels:

 - The interactive R console (entire left)
 - Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
 - Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

If you click on the *View/Panes/Pane* Layout menu item, you can move these quadrants around.  I tend to like the console to be top left and scripts to be top right, with the plots and environment on the bottom - but this is  personal choice. 

```{r, tut1cfig2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('Tutorial1c_fig2Rstudio.png')
```

<br> 

If you wish to learn more about what these windows do, have a look at this resource, from the Pirates Guide to R: https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/the-four-rstudio-windows.html.  

**If you have used R before, you might see that there are variables and plots etc already loaded**.  It is always good to clear these before you start a new analysis.  To do this, click the little broom symbol in your environment tab.

</div> 
### Change a few settings

R-studio wants to be helpful and will try to re-load exactly where you were in a project when you log back in.  This can get really confusing, so we are going to turn this off.

ON A MAC: Click on the R-studio menu button on the top left of the screen, then click Preferences. 

ON A PC: Click on Tools-> Global Options -> Preferences

Now:

 - UNCLICK "Restore most recently opened project at startup"
 - Set "Save workspace to .RData on" exit to Never
