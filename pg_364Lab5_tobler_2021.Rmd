## Welcome to Lab 5!

<br>

The aim of this lab is to work on autocorrelation, especially join counts and census data. By the end of the lab you will be able to:

1.  Create a matrix of data
2.  Conduct a join counts analysis on "toy data"
3.  Download census data and conduct a real life analysis

Assignment 5 is due by midnight the night before your next lab on Canvas. Your job is to submit the requirements on this page.

See [**your canvas assignment here**](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2120046/assignments/13274838).

<p class="comment">**Need help?** Add a screenshot/question to the discussion board here: [**LAB 5 DISCUSSION BOARD**](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2120046/discussion_topics/14125716)</p>

<br> <br>

## A: Set up the lab

<br>

### A1: Sign up for Census API

You can easily access US census data within R, but you need to sign up in advance for a password.

<https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>

You can use Penn State as the organisation. This is just you promising that you will follow the terms and conditions when using this data. In a few minutes, e-mail you a personal access code. Click the link in the e-mail to activate.

<br> <br>

### A2: Create your lab project

<br>

Follow the instructions in Labs 1-4 to create your project file and a blank markdown document. e.g. <br>

1.  Open R-Studio. Create a new R-Project in your GEOG-364 folder called `GEOG364_Lab5_PROJECT`.<br>

2.  Make a copy of the lab template Rmd file and move it into your project folder.

3.  DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GEOG364_Lab5_PROJECT.RPROJ FILE IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER TO OPEN R.<br>

4.  Click on your lab 5 .Rmd file in the files tab to open the script<br>(You should not have to search if you are in your Lab 5 project):<br>

    -   Change the title to Lab 5. <br>
    -   Change the theme if you like or add in any other features <br>
    -   Remember you can edit your lab in the "editor" mode by clicking on the A at the top right

5.  **IN THE CONSOLE (OR BY CLICKING THE INSTALL BUTTON IN THE PACKAGES TAB), install the `VIM` package. DO NOT PUT THE CODE IN YOUR SCRIPT OR IT WILL TRY TO DOWNLOAD EVERY TIME YOU PRESS KNIT** (For more instructions, see [Tutorial 2: Package Install](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2021/pg_Tut2_startup.html#How_to_downloadinstall_packages))

<br><br>

### A3: Libraries and the top code chunk

Let's continue to make our code more professional. There is rarely a reason to show a reader the libraries being loaded. So this time, let's add in the libraries into the top code chunk.

Edit your code chunk that looks like this

```{r, L5Fig1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig1.png')
```

and turn it into this, which should disappear when you press knit.

```{r, L5Fig2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig2.png')
```

Feel free to also update this in your code template - then as you need libraries (e.g. if you run your code and it's missing a library, you can then proactively just add it into this code chunk)

<br><br>

## B: New R coding

### B1: Custom commands:  Functions

We don't need to just rely on commands that others provide.  We can also create our own, as you will see later on. You will not be asked to make your own in this class, but it is a useful skill and you could consider making and running a mini function as your "show me something new".

Here is a good overview of functions where they make a custom command to turn Celcius into Farenheit:
 - https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/02-func-R/
 

### B2: Asking Questions: If statements

Sometimes we only want R to do something *if* something else happens. e.g. run this command if I want to see the output, or run another command if our result is greater than 10.  The if statement allows us to do this.

if(a > b){
  do output commands
}else{
  do something else
}

You can read this like a sentence e.g. "if a is greater than b, do the output commands in the first bit, else do the other stuff."

Again, you will not be asked to make your own in this class, but it is a useful skill and you could consider making if statements as your "show me something new".

Here is a good overview of if-else
 - https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/if-else-statement/


<br><br>

## C: Join Counts

We will first explore the theory, then create a toy dataset, then manually run a hyothesis test, then auto-create one.

### C1: Join Counts theory

Join count statistics are valuable autocorrelation statistics in understanding spatial dependencies amongst binary or categorical data.

<br>

1.  **Step 1:**<br> [**DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!**]{.ul} Go to Canvas and read the pdf on join counts from canvas (chapter 15.1 of the textbook) - it's only 4 pages but provides crucial background.

<br>

2.  **Step 2:**<br> In your code, create a new heading called Join Counts. Briefly explain what join counts are and why it is only appropriate to use use them for categorical or binary data (yes/no ; TRUE/FALSE). Feel free to use pictures/examples etc to help you explain it.

<br> <br>

### C2: Join Counts coding

This section focuses on using R to calculate join count statistics using a toy dataset. We will:

a)  C2a: Create a test "toy" dataset (note normally you would read your own data in from file)
b)  C2b: Create a spatial weights matrix using spdep
c)  C2c: Manually understand what we are doing in a join counts analysis.
c)  C2d: Formally set up a hypothesis test
d)  C2d: Use the `joincount.test` command to automatically calculate it.

#### C2a. Create the test dataset

Let's work on a "toy" (tiny/easy/made-up) dataset. Here's a picture of the grid we are going to make. In this case, each polygon is a simple grid cell.

```{r, L5Fig4, echo=FALSE,out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig4.png')
```

<br>

As we are making up imaginary data, we need to create it in R. Now, I will create this in R using a new type of data called a matrix. This is simply a grid of numbers (see data camp intro R for more details: <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matrices-in-r>)

```{r}
row.1 <- rep(1,6)  
row.2 <- c(0,1,1,1,1,1)
row.3 <- c(rep(0,5),1)
row.4 <- rep(0,6)
row.5 <- c(0,0,0,1,0,0)
row.6 <- rep(0,6)

ToyA_matrix <- matrix(c(row.1, row.2, row.3, row.4, row.5, row.6), 
                      nrow=6,ncol=6, byrow=TRUE)

ToyA_matrix
```

We then convert it to spatial data using the raster command - and then make a plot with a title:

```{r, fig.width=5}
ToyA_raster <- raster(ToyA_matrix)

plot(ToyA_raster)
text(coordinates(ToyA_raster), labels=ToyA_raster[], cex=1.5)
```

<br>

3.  **Step 3:**<br> Explain in your lab answers what the `rep()` and `c()` commands do. Feel free to use code examples!

<br>

4.  **Step 4:**<br> Use the code above to create your own matrix that you assign to a variable called called `ToyB_matrix`. <br> **You should create your grid to generally have negative spatial autocorrelation, but still include a little bit of randomness.**<br>Your grid could also have additional rows and column as you desire. 


<p class="comment">All the way through my example, I use ToyA_... for my variable names. e.g. `ToyA_raster`, `ToyA_matrix` Name yours ToyB_... to keep your code neat </p>


<br> <br>

#### C2b. Creating a spatial weights matrix

Now, we will convert our dataset to a specifica type of spatial data (spdep), so that we can determine which grid-cells are "nearby" and create a spatial weights matrix. To find adjacent polygons, we can use package 'spdep'.

1.  First, we covert our raster data to a spatial polygon using `rasterToPolygons` and `SpatialPolygons`

2.  Then we use the `poly2nb` command to build a list of neighbors based on adjacency (queens or rooks)

3.  Calculate the weights matrix. In this case we use a binary (B) criteria, i.e. there is adjacency (1) or there is no adjacency (0).

4.  And plot.

Here's the code:

```{r}
# Step 1 - turn to polygon
ToyA_polygon    <- rasterToPolygons(ToyA_raster, dissolve=FALSE)
ToyA_spdep      <- SpatialPolygons(ToyA_polygon@polygons)

# Step 2 - Make list of neighbors
ToyA_nb.rook <- poly2nb(ToyA_spdep, queen = FALSE)

# Step 3 - Create weights matrix
ToyA_weights.rook <- nb2listw(ToyA_nb.rook, style='B')

# Step 4 - plot the neighbors
plot(ToyA_spdep, border='blue')
plot(ToyA_nb.rook, coordinates(ToyA_spdep), col='red', lwd=2, add=TRUE)
```

<br> <br>

5.  **Step 5:**<br> In your answer, make a sub-heading called Spatial weights matrix. Explain what a spatial-weights-matrix is, how adjacency can been used to create one (e.g. what are queens/rooks) or how distance might be used to create one (lecture 8A, Lecture 7B). **

<br>

6.  **Step 6:**<br> Use the code above to create a spatial weights matrix for `ToyB_matrix`. <br> **Use a queen's weights matrix in your example**

<br>

7. **Step 7:**<br> Explain why your Queens adjacecy plot for the Toy_B data looks identical to my Rooks adjacecy plot for the Toy_A data.

<br><br>

#### C2c. Conduct a join count analysis manually

Sometimes this process can feel like a blackbox


<br>

Now, everything is set for the analyses: I have my spatial data (`ToyA_polygon`), which shows our pattern of green/white grid cells, plus our spatial weights matrix saved as variable `ToyA_weights.rook`.

We can now conduct a join counts test to evaluate the presence of absence of spatial autocorrelation. As described in the textbook, essentially we are looking at the boundaries between polygons are the same color (e.g. two green polygons next to each other, two white polygons next to each other), which suggests clustering, or whether there are lots of green-white boundaries, suggesting a chessboard effect/negative autocorrelation.

We can theoretically calculate (on average) how many green-green, white-white, green-white boundaries there would be if an Independent Random Process caused the pattern.

For example, here is how I would use an Independent Random Process to create the a matrix of the same shape but filled with random 1s and 0s. I'm using the "function" command to make a custom command that I am calling `toyIRP`.  

```{r}
toyIRP <- function(nrow=6,ncolumn=6, silent=FALSE){

  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # create X random numbers between 0 and 1  (runif, = random uniform generator)
  # use the round function to turn them into either a 0 (< 0.5) or a 1 (>= 0.5)
  # X is the number of cells e.g. 6 rows and 6 columns makes 36 pieces of data
  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  randomnumbers <- runif(nrow*ncolumn,0,1)
  randombinary <- round(randomnumbers)
  
  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Turn into a matrix and create the weights etc.
  #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  IRP_matrix   <- matrix(randombinary, nrow=nrow,ncol=ncolumn, byrow=TRUE)
  IRP_raster   <- raster(IRP_matrix)
  IRP_polygon  <- rasterToPolygons(IRP_raster, dissolve=FALSE)
  IRP_spdep    <- SpatialPolygons(IRP_polygon@polygons)
  IRP_nb.rook  <- poly2nb(IRP_spdep, queen = FALSE)
  IRP_weights.rook <- nb2listw(IRP_nb.rook, style='B')
  IRB_jointest <- joincount.test(fx    = as.factor(IRP_polygon$layer), listw = IRP_weights.rook) 
  
  ww_gg_joincount <- IRB_jointest[[1]]$estimate[1]+  IRB_jointest[[2]]$estimate[1]
  
  # If you want to see the output (e.g. silent=FALSE) then plot
  if(silent == FALSE){
    plot(IRP_raster, 
         main = list(paste("Number of same color (WW or GG) boundaries = ",ww_gg_joincount),cex=.9))
    text(coordinates(IRP_raster), labels=IRP_raster[], cex=1.5)
  }
  
  return(ww_gg_joincount)
}
```


<br> 

8. **Step 8:**<br> Create a new code chunk and copy the code above into your script. When you press run, nothing should happen, but you will see a new "function" appear in your Environment quadrant/tab.


9. **Step 9:**<br> In a new code chunk, copy this code and run. It should make a random pattern that tells you the numbers of same-color joins.  Run it again, and again.. keep going and get a sense for how an IRP created process looks and the number of same-color joins each time,<br> *If you are confused, To fully understand, try editing the nunmber of rows and columns to make a mini one e.g. try 2 rows and 2 columns and you can count white-white and green-green boundaries manually*


```{r}
output <- toyIRP(nrow=6,ncolumn=6, silent=FALSE)
```


10. **Step 10:**<br> On average, if an IRP really did cause the pattern for a 6x6 matrix, how many same-colorjoins would you expect to see? Why does the number change each time you run it?

<br>

11. **Step 11:**<br> Now, let's run the code many times (1001 times!), store the number of same color joins each time and make a histogram of the output.  Copy/run the code below, I have turned the plotting off. It is running the command 1000 times, so it might take a minute.

```{r}
# Run once
alloutput <-  toyIRP(nrow=6,ncolumn=6, silent=TRUE)
  
# Repeat 200 times and add in the answer
for(n in 1:1000){
  newIRP <- toyIRP(nrow=6,ncolumn=6, silent=TRUE)
  alloutput <-  c(alloutput, newIRP)
}  

#make a histogram of all the white-white joins
hist(alloutput, br=20, main="The number of same color joins for 1001 variations of an IRP")
```

<br>

12. **Step 12:**<br> Given this output, what is your new expectation of the number of same-color joins if an IRP caused the process?


What we just did above is called a Monte-Carlo process. We repeated something many times and looked to see our range of outcomes.  This can be very powerful as it can allow you do deal with things like edge effects. But as you saw from your readings, in this case, we could have theoretically calculated the number of joins if an IRP caused the pattern, using this equation.  Note, it doesn't mean that an IRP will ALWAYS cause the "expected number", this equation just calcuates the mean of the histogram.

```{r, L5Fig8, echo=FALSE,out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig8.png')
```

12. **Step 12:**<br> Using this equation, if you have a 6x6 grid, how many same colour joins would you theoretically expect (hint, it would be the total number of joins minus E_BW)

<br>

Now let's compare against our data.  We can run the same command on our Toy dataset A to see how many white-white joins there are. As you can see, the number of white-white boundaries is 48, which would be very unusually high considering histogram of outputs from the Independent Random Process.  So this suggests maybe the data is clustered e.g. there are an unusual amount of greens polygons touching green polygons and whites touching whites.

```{r}
# run the command
 ToyA_jointest <- joincount.test(fx = as.factor(ToyA_polygon$layer), 
                                listw = ToyA_weights.rook,        
                                alternative = "greater") 
 numberboundaries <- ToyA_jointest[[1]]$estimate[1]+  ToyA_jointest[[2]]$estimate[1]


# and plot
 plot(ToyA_raster, main = paste("TOYA: Number of same color boundaries =",numberboundaries))
 text(coordinates(ToyA_raster), labels=ToyA_raster[], cex=1.5)

```

13. **Step 13:**<br> Repeat the code above but edit for your matrix (ToyB). Comparing against the histogram, is the number of white-white boundaries unusally high/low?? Does this suggest your data is unusually clustered/uniform compared to one created by an IRP?


#### C2d. Formally set up a hypothesis test

**That process above, where we choose a process we understand and then see whether our results are unusual compared to it, that is literally all a hyothesis test is!!**

The steps are:

 - Choose a process to compare against (in our case an IRP caused the data)
 - Think of a thing you can compare (in our case, the number of same-color joins)
 - Either manually repeat your process a few thousand times and record that thing (our histogram).. OR theoretically calculate what you might expect.  
 - Calculate the same thing for our actual observed data
 - Use a test statistic to asses how unusual our is (because the histogram is a probability density function, we can use a z-score here.)

And here is the summary you often see as the record of that process (note, its often unspoken that an IRP causes H0, you don't have to use one which is why I'm being specific)

```{r, L5Fig3, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="*Join Count Summary from the McGrew textbook, O_BW is the observed black-white joins, E_BW is the expected from an IRP*"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig3.png')
```

We often don't want to manually repeat the previous section. So here's how to set up the test.  Rather than looking at "same color" or "different color", the R code likes to look at "white-white" joins individually so we will use that.

NOTE - WE CAN NEVER TEST IF OUR PATTERN IS "CLUSTERED", BUT WE CAN TEST HOW UNUSUAL IT IS TO ONE WHERE SPATIAL DEPENDENCE DOESN'T EXIST.

<br>

#### Null hypothesis, H~0~ : What process are you comparing against? {.unnumbered}

Here we are suggesting that our pattern is *caused* by an Independent Random Process.

Although the default code is set to test against an IRP generated pattern, you don't *have* to use one - e.g. you could manually test if pattern is more/less clustered than one caused by some other process that you care about like distance to a power station.

If that is the case then we can say things like 

H~0~: An Independent Random Process is causing the pattern. Therefore the observed  O~WW~ \= E~WW~


<br>

#### Alternative hypothesis, H~1~ {.unnumbered}

This could be one of three things, depending on the *direction* of our test:

-   H~1~ : Our pattern is **different** than we would expect from one caused by an IRP e.g. it's EITHER unusually clustered or uniform ("2 tailed test") <br> So we're saying this pattern is unusual given the process or..

-   H~1~ : Our pattern is **more** **clustered** than we would expect from one caused by an IRP ("one tailed test") <br> or...

-   H~1~ : Our pattern is **less** **clustered/more uniform** than we would expect from one caused by an IRP ("one tailed test")

#### Turning words into maths

The way we are testing "clustered" is by looking at the number of "joins" e.g. is a white cell next to a white cell, or a green cell next to a green cell? (see the reading and the lectures for more).

We could calculate the average number we would get theoretically and then compare against our observed value for our specific pattern.

This means we can turn our hypotheses into:

Finally, we apply the Join Count test to evaluate presence or absence or spatial autocorrelation. This is done using a z-test.

We can choose if the test is two sides.

Slightly differently to the textbook and the lecture notes (which looked for green/white), the R version of this test looks for how likely it is that there are white-to-white joins compared to random chance, but the principle is the same.

So we have:

-   H0: The pattern exhibits complete spatial randomness or is dispersed.<br>*The number of Observed "same color" joins (O~White-White~) is no higher than what you would expect from a pattern caused by an Independent Random Process: O~WW~ = E~WW~*

-   H1: The pattern is not random. The number of "same color" joins is unusually high (AKA the pattern is clustered): O~WW~ \> E~WW~

Here is the code for the Z-test

```{r}
ToyA_jointest <- joincount.test(fx    = as.factor(ToyA_polygon$layer), 
                                listw = ToyA_weights.rook,             
                                alternative = "greater") 
```

Another thing to note is that you can select which different tailed alternative hypothesis:

-   (default) 'greater': the alternative hypothesis that the number of like joins is more than expected by random chance. *(THIS IS ONLY TRUE IF THE THING YOU ARE TESTING IS WW or GG joins. The opposite would be the case if you tested GW joins, think through why this is the case)*
-   'less': the alternative hypothesis that the number of like joins is fewer than expected by random chance (indicating higher levels of dispersion). *(IF THE THING YOU ARE TESTING IS WW or GG joins. The opposite would be the case if you tested GW joins.)*
-   'two.sided': the alternative hypothesis that the number of like joins is simply different to the number you would expect from random chance. This is unusual to use as we are normally looking for either clustering or dispersion.

joincount.test actually does two tests, so we use double square brackets [[ ]] to show the first and second test separately:

```{r}
# White-to-white Join counts
ToyA_jointest[[1]]
```

```{r}
# Green-to-green Join counts
ToyA_jointest[[2]]
```

We can see that there are many more white-white joins / green-green joins than you might expect. In fact, looking at the low p-value, we can see that it is very unusual to see so many same-color joins, so in this case, most people can can safely reject the null hypothesis.

<br>

<br>

**C. Interpretation**

*How many white-to-white joins were observed vs expected in the example above? How many green-to-green joins were observed vs expected? What does that mean in terms of the spatial autocorrelation of the field and why?* **[4 marks]**

*Do you accept or reject your null hypothesis?* **[4 marks]**

#### C1. Real life interpretation

In 2010, Staudt et al, published a paper on the foraging behaviour and territoriality of the strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio). Twelve male frogs in Hitoy Cerere, Costa Rica, were observed each for a full day. Calling time, feeding attempts and time spent inside and outside the core area of their territories were recorded.

```{r, L5Fig5, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="The strawberry poison frog"}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig5.png')
```

The connectivity of grids where frogs were observed feeding in the main foraging time was analysed with "Joins Count Statistics", which tests whether the spatial connection of grids differed from a random spatial distribution. The test counts the number of connected grids in a binary system; in this case a "foraging grid" is marked black and a "non-foraging grid" is marked white. The results indicate whether or not frogs favour special areas (patches) in their territories for prey hunting. If they search in patches, there should be more connections between black-black grids and fewer connections between black-white grids than in a random distribution.

Each 4 m2 core area was divided in 100 20 × 20 cm2 grids. B (black) = grid in which was hunted. W (white) = grid in which was not hunted. The Join Count results for two frogs are as follows:

```{r, L5Fig6, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig6.png')
```

**Frog question 1**

The paper did not provide a map of how the territories looked - if you had to choose one of the maps below, which is most likely? Why?

```{r, L5Fig7, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('pg_364Lab5_tobler_2021_fig7.png')
```

**Frog question 2**

At a significance value of 0.01, do these results indicate that the frogs preferred hunting prey in specific patches of their core areas? Or is there no evidence to reject the notion that they randomly hunted whereever they hopped?
